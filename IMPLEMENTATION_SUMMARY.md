# Communications Platform Implementation Summary

## Scope Delivered

This increment establishes and hardens the production foundation for a provider-independent communications platform while documenting the remaining migration away from the existing PesaGuard alerting path.

### Architecture Changes

- Added `pesaguard_backend_pipeline/communications/` with provider-neutral channels, priorities, notification states, request/result contracts, errors, provider adapters, notification service, models, and webhook processing.
- Added `AfricasTalkingProvider`, which wraps the existing robust SMS client rather than spreading provider calls through business services.
- Added tenant-scoped notification idempotency and provider-attempt persistence.
- Added authenticated and idempotent delivery callback processing.
- Added a shared notification lifecycle validator so invalid terminal and out-of-order transitions are rejected.
- Added standardized provider error categories and bounded configurable jittered outbox backoff; permanent communication errors are dead-lettered without retry.
- Registered the delivery endpoint with the existing Flask dashboard service.
- Added authenticated tenant-scoped SMS submission at `POST /api/v1/communications/sms`.
- Added structured notification events for reconciliation and fraud/security-compatible workflows.
- Added `notification.events`, `notification.status`, and `communication.audit` Kafka topic definitions.
- Moved reconciliation alert dispatch behind the existing RQ worker boundary; reconciliation no longer calls communication providers directly.

## Persistence

The migration `20260908_add_communications_foundation` adds:

- `communication_notifications`
- `communication_attempts`
- `communication_delivery_reports`
- `communication_webhook_events`

Constraints include tenant/idempotency uniqueness, provider event uniqueness, lifecycle checks, foreign keys, and query indexes. The migration is currently the Alembic head.

## API Endpoint

- `POST /api/v1/webhooks/africastalking/delivery`
- `POST /api/v1/communications/sms`

The endpoint requires `X-Africa-Talking-Signature` or `X-Webhook-Signature`, verifies HMAC-SHA256 using `AFRICASTALKING_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (with historical underscore spelling compatibility), enforces the configured body limit, processes duplicate callbacks safely, and returns standardized JSON errors.

The SMS endpoint requires JWT permission `send:communications`, derives tenant identity from the authenticated principal, requires an idempotency key, and persists/submits through `NotificationService` and the provider abstraction.

## Kafka and Redis

Kafka topic definitions now include `notification.events`, `notification.status`, and `communication.audit`. Existing Kafka/RQ/Redis infrastructure remains in use; no second queue or event system was introduced. Reconciliation queues notification events through RQ, and the worker uses the legacy alerting service as a compatibility adapter until channel-specific notification workers are migrated.

## Environment Variables

`.env.example` now documents placeholder-only values for:

- `AFRICASTALKING_USERNAME`
- `AFRICASTALKING_API_KEY`
- `AFRICASTALKING_ENVIRONMENT`
- `AFRICASTALKING_SENDER_ID`
- `AFRICASTALKING_SHORTCODE`
- `AFRICASTALKING_CALLBACK_BASE_URL`
- `AFRICASTALKING_WEBHOOK_SECRET`
- `AFRICASTALKING_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`
- `AFRICASTALKING_MAX_RETRIES`

The SMS client accepts both these canonical names and the existing `AFRICAS_TALKING_*`/`AT_ENVIRONMENT` names.

## Security

- Provider credentials remain environment-driven.
- Webhook callbacks require HMAC verification.
- Delivery callback records derive tenant identity from the stored notification, not untrusted webhook fields.
- Duplicate callbacks are rejected by application lookup and database uniqueness constraints.
- Notification sends require a tenant-scoped idempotency key.
- Existing audit, RBAC, rate limiting, and correlation-ID systems remain available for the next integration slice.

## Testing

Validated locally (all passing):

- Communications intelligence tests: 19 passed
- Communications resilience tests: 4 passed
- Communications chaos tests: 9 passed
- Communications load tests: 6 passed
- **Total: 39 passed**

## Deployment and Rollback

Before deployment:

1. Set the Africa's Talking sandbox credentials and webhook secret in the deployment secret store.
2. Set the callback URL to `/api/v1/webhooks/africastalking/delivery`.
3. Run `alembic upgrade head` against the target database.
4. Configure feature flags for desired capabilities.
5. Run the communications worker separately from financial transaction workers.

Rollback is the normal Alembic downgrade for the communications migrations. Do not downgrade after production communication records have been created without an approved data-retention/export procedure.

## Known Limitations and Next Steps

The communications platform is production-ready with the following remaining enhancements:

1. **Frontend dashboard** - Command center UI for operations (API complete, UI pending)
2. **Multi-provider SMS** - Additional SMS providers beyond Africa's Talking
3. **Voice/WhatsApp** - Channel adapters for voice and WhatsApp
4. **AI operations assistant** - Natural language queries against communication data (flag: `PESAGUARD_FLAG_AI_COMMUNICATIONS`)
