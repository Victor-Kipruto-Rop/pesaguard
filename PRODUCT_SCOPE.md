# PesaGuard Product Scope Decision

This document satisfies requirements **SCOPE-1** through **SCOPE-4** from Addendum III.

---

## Current scope (SCOPE-1)

**PesaGuard reconciles M-Pesa transactions via the Safaricom Daraja API only.**

| In scope | Out of scope (pilot) |
|---|---|
| M-Pesa C2B/B2C webhook ingestion | Airtel Money |
| Daraja transaction status queries | Bank transfer / RTGS reconciliation |
| Internal-ledger matching (Postgres, Sheets, REST) against M-Pesa records | Card payments, PayPal, other rails |
| Anomaly detection on M-Pesa reconciliation gaps | Multi-rail unified payment inbox |

**Timeline for expansion:** No committed date. Expansion is a **separate phase** triggered only by a concrete pilot requirement and re-scoping exercise — not mid-build scope creep (**SCOPE-4**).

---

## Reasoning

1. The entire ingestion pipeline, webhook validators, and Daraja auth client are M-Pesa-specific today.
2. Pilot positioning targets SACCOs and SMEs whose primary payment pain is M-Pesa reconciliation.
3. Building Airtel Money or bank connectors speculatively would delay pilot value without validated demand.

---

## Customer-facing statement (SCOPE-2)

> PesaGuard currently monitors and reconciles **M-Pesa (Daraja) transactions only**. If your business also accepts Airtel Money, bank transfers, or other payment methods, those transactions are **not** included in reconciliation or alerting until a future release. Contact us if multi-rail support is a hard requirement — that becomes a separate scoping conversation.

This statement appears in:

- Dashboard scope banner (`scope.label` in locale files)
- `docs/customer/GETTING_STARTED_en.md` and `GETTING_STARTED_sw.md`
- `docs/customer/FAQ_en.md` and `FAQ_sw.md`

---

## Future expansion path (SCOPE-3)

If a pilot customer requires multi-payment-method reconciliation, evaluate reusing the existing **`BaseConnector`** pattern as a **`PaymentSourceConnector`** abstraction:

```python
# Conceptual — not implemented until a customer requirement justifies it
class PaymentSourceConnector(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def fetch_recent_payments(self, since_minutes: int) -> Iterable[Dict[str, Any]]:
        """Normalized: payment_ref, amount, payer_id, timestamp, rail, status"""
        ...
```

| Existing pattern | Reuse for payment rails |
|---|---|
| `BaseConnector.fetch_recent_records()` | Same normalized-record idea for internal ledger |
| `ConnectorRegistry.from_env()` | Per-tenant, per-rail connector registration |
| Reconciliation job matching logic | Should compare on normalized fields, not M-Pesa-specific keys |

**Do not refactor core reconciliation to this pattern until a paying customer needs a second rail.** Document the evaluation here; implement when scoped.

### Rails under consideration (unordered, uncommitted)

| Rail | Integration path | Effort estimate | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Airtel Money | Partner API / file export | Medium–High | Not started |
| Bank transfers | Statement import / open banking | High | Not started |
| Additional M-Pesa products | Daraja APIs already partially integrated | Low–Medium | In scope via Daraja |

---

## When a pilot asks for multi-rail support (SCOPE-4)

1. **Do not** silently add connectors during the current build.
2. Schedule a scoping call using Phase 0 discovery questions:
   - *"Besides M-Pesa, do you take payments through Airtel Money, bank transfer, or anything else we'd need to reconcile?"*
3. Produce a separate phase proposal: connectors needed, timeline, pricing, residency impact.
4. Update this document with the agreed expansion plan before development starts.

## Validation

Kiswahili scope statements and customer docs should be reviewed by a Kiswahili-speaking user or pilot candidate before being treated as final (*pending real-world input*).
