# PesaGuard Disaster Recovery

## Overview
This document describes the daily backup process, offsite storage, and restore procedure for the PesaGuard Postgres database and Kafka replay capability.

## Backup Policy
- Frequency: daily backup of Postgres data using `pg_dump`.
- Retention: keep daily backups for 30 days and weekly archive snapshots for 6 months.
- Storage: backup files should be copied off the primary host to separate object storage or backup storage.
- Recovery target: restore from the most recent backup within the retention window.

## Backup Commands
### Create a Postgres dump
```bash
export PGPASSWORD="${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-pesaguard}"
pg_dump -h ${POSTGRES_HOST:-localhost} -p ${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432} -U ${POSTGRES_USER:-pesaguard} -F c -b -v -f "pesaguard-backup-$(date +%F).dump" ${POSTGRES_DB:-pesaguard}
```

### Verify the backup file
```bash
pg_restore -l pesaguard-backup-$(date +%F).dump | head -n 20
```

### Copy backup off-host
```bash
aws s3 cp pesaguard-backup-$(date +%F).dump s3://pesaguard-backups/$(date +%F)/pesaguard-backup.dump
```

## Kafka Retention
Kafka should be configured with deliberate retention settings so replay is possible after an incident.
For the local Docker Compose setup, metrics are configured in `docker/docker-compose.yml`:
- `KAFKA_LOG_RETENTION_HOURS: 168` (7 days)
- `KAFKA_LOG_RETENTION_BYTES: 10737418240` (10 GiB)

## Restore Procedure
### 1. Prepare a recovery environment
1. Provision a recovery VM or container with Postgres installed.
2. Create a fresh database if needed:
   ```bash
dropdb --if-exists pesaguard
createdb -h localhost -U ${POSTGRES_USER:-pesaguard} ${POSTGRES_DB:-pesaguard}
```

### 2. Restore from backup
```bash
export PGPASSWORD="${POSTGRES_PASSWORD:-pesaguard}"
pg_restore -h ${POSTGRES_HOST:-localhost} -p ${POSTGRES_PORT:-5432} -U ${POSTGRES_USER:-pesaguard} -d ${POSTGRES_DB:-pesaguard} -v "pesaguard-backup-YYYY-MM-DD.dump"
```

### 3. Verify restore success
```bash
psql -h ${POSTGRES_HOST:-localhost} -U ${POSTGRES_USER:-pesaguard} -d ${POSTGRES_DB:-pesaguard} -c "SELECT count(*) FROM discrepancy;"
```

### 4. Verify application startup
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_3.txt
python pesaguard_backend_pipeline/app_2.py
```

## Restore Drill
- Quarterly test: restore the latest backup to an isolated environment and exercise the dashboard read/write flow.
- Confirm the restored database contains recent records and the reconciliation API starts successfully.

## Notes
- The listed retention periods are placeholders and should be adjusted according to contractual and compliance requirements.
- Store backup files in a separate storage location from the production VM.
